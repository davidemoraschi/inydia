DHTML Behaviors Library - Calendar
===================================
Last Updated: Oct.14,1999


SUMMARY
========
The calendar behavior is used to provide a quick and easy method for users to 
find and select a date. It can be used in any situation where date input is 
required, such as on a web page form, in utilities, or in applications.  

 
DETAILS
========
The calendar behavior inserts a calendar control into a Web page. The calendar 
consists of three main sections. 

1.) The title area displays the month, year, and month and year list boxes. 

2.) Days of the week are ordered horizontally below the title area. 

3.) The individual days of the month, including overlapping days from the 
    previous and following month, are contained in a grid below the days of 
    the week. 


BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
Behaviors are supported in Internet Explorer 5 for the Win32 and Unix platforms. 
Any browser that doesn't support behaviors will ignore them.
